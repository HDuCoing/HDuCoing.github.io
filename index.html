CyberSecurity - Networking Commands
Where I document my Cyber Security learning and progress.

Various branches are provided for detailed portions.

Ping
ping test whether a connection to a remote resource is possible

For example to obtain the IP Address of a certain website do; "ping "

-i : change the interval of sent ping requests -4 : allow you to restrict requests to IPv4 -v : verbose output

Traceroute
traceroute Traceroute allows you to see each of these connections, it allows you to see every intermediate step between your computer and the resource that you requested.

For example to obtain a detailed trace for a website do; "traceroute " and it will give you each 'hop' to the destination.

-i : specify an interface when using Traceroute -t : use TCP SYN requests when tracing the route
