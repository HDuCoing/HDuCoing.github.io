My name is Holly DuCoing and you can find me in the Wellington region of New Zealand. Im nearly finished with my Bachelor of Information Sciences majoring in Computer Science and have a wide range of skills and passions.

My main coding languages are Python, Java, C#. I am always on a journey to extend my coding language comprehension. I am nearly comfortable with Javascript and I have been learning React Js, Node Js and a variety of other web development languages. 

I have several person projects in the works and am always looking to expand my portfolio.
